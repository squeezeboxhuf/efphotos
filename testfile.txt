Joy and Jacqui to Lautrec's. Doctor regarding jabs for Singapore 15h10, I don't need anything, Joy needs and had straight away a polio (on sugar cube), we both need ??? for India. Completed loading the CD player, it'll definitely be a good way to make me listen to my less popular discs! Gig for Methsoc Mangle 20h30 - 22h30 at Derby Road (now called Lenton) church.

Lyndi+Russ round for lunch at Lautrec's, Joy and Lyndi's lasagne was salty, we had free coffees! Popped to work, email to "S.P. and E" refereeing a paper they had sent, collected faxed map from Jean of their Cornwall house, collected faxed map of tonight's hotel in Oadby and faxed it on to Hamish.

Depart 10h00 to drive down to Joan+Gerry's. Fast run, but huge pile-up on the other side of the M1 blocking part of our side too, averaged 60 mph until we got off the motorway towards Woking, arrive 12h30. Wonderful lunch, and walk round their local common. Dropped off our VW at Don+Mary's, arrived Heathrow 19h00. Singapore Airlines SQ321 report 20h00 depart 22h15. After checking (seats 59D and E, middle block, near the back) in we bought books to read, and booze for gifts. The aircraft has individual TV screens in every seat, you can watch any of 22 TV channels (including the usual map of our position) and play interactive games, and make phone calls (but it costs a lot on your credit card). Good meal (Joy had chicken, I had sweet and sour fish) then we watched different films. Very bumpy in places, Joy says her worst ever.

###17 March 1997
Written 16h00 Singapore time Monday just N of Sri Lanka. Height 11300m, speed 1030 kph, predicted arrival 30 minutes early at 18h30, outside temp -49 degrees. Breakfast = omelette, nice and cheesy but too rubbery. Arrive Singapore half an hour early at 18h30. Passport check very quick, luggage 5 minutes. Changed � 200 at 2.247 into S$450. No-one was waiting for us, so we caught a taxi to Kismis Avenue flats (I told him the way, Jalan Jurong Kechil, Toh Yi Close, Kismis Avenue!), S$17, we were just starting to look around when Parv appeared with the keys. We unpacked, and slobbed. There seems to be everything we need. The radio is already tuned into BBC World Service, they said that John Major has just announced the election for 1st May, the longest ever election campaign. At least 2 (one Singaporian, one Malaysian) English speaking channels on the TV.
